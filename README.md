Background:

Imagine you're working on a mobile app for a fintech company that allows users to track their
expenses and incomes. As part of the app's functionality, users should be able to categorize
their transactions into different categories such as groceries, transportation, utilities, etc.

Task:
Create a React Native component that allows users to add a new transaction with the following
details:
● Amount (numeric input)
● Description (text input)
● Date (date picker)
● Category (dropdown/select input with predefined categories: groceries, transportation,
utilities, etc.)
●

Requirements:
● Implement a clean and user-friendly interface for adding transactions.
● Ensure validation for the amount field (positive numeric values only).
● Provide a mechanism for selecting the transaction category from a predefined list.
● Implement date picker functionality for selecting the transaction date.
● Use appropriate React Native components for inputs and UI elements.
● Make the component reusable and easy to integrate into other application parts.
● Ensure the code is well-organized, readable, and follows best practices.

Additional Information:
You can use any additional libraries or tools as necessary.
Consider handling edge cases and potential errors gracefully.
Feel free to add any extra features or enhancements that you think would improve the user
experience or functionality.

Submission:
Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository and invite Stashngr or a ZIP file containing
the code. Include any necessary instructions for running the application or any additional notes
about your implementation.
